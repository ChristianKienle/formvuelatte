## Getting Started

FormVueLatte is a zero dependency library that allows you to generate schema-driven forms with extreme ease.

The schema that you use for your form can be as flexible as you need it to be, it can be modified at run-time with an expected reactive result, and can even be fetched directly from you backend's API.

### Installation

To add FormVueLatte to your project, start by installing the package through your favorite package manager.

```bash
yarn add formvuelatte

// OR

npm install formvuelatte
```

Now that you have the package in your project, `import` it to your component.

```js
import { SchemaForm } from 'formvuelatte'
```

The `SchemaForm` requires two `props`. The first is the `schema`, which is the configuration of your form. The second one is `value`, which will hold the state of the form.

```html
<SchemaForm :schema="mySchema" :value="formData" />
```

The `SchemaForm` will `$emit` **input** events when your components update. This means that you are able to either use `v-model` on it, or manually capture the `@input` event with a method of your own, as well as inject the `:value` property. Either or.

Below you will find an example of the previous concepts.

```html
<template>
  <SchemaForm :schema="mySchema" v-model="formData" />
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      formData: {},
      mySchema: { 
        //some schema here
      }
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

## The schema prop
The `SchemaForm` component requires you to pass it a `schema` property. This `schema` can be both an `object` or an `array`, although under the hood it will be transformed to an `array`.

In its simplest form, the `schema` requires you to provide a `name: value` pair for each of the form components you want to add to your form. Let's assume for this example that you have a component in your project called `FormText` which exposes an `<input>` tag with some CSS.

```html
<template>
    <SchemaForm :schema="schema" />
</template>

<script>
    import { SchemaForm } from 'formvuelatte'
    import FormText from 'path/to/FormText';

    export default {
        components: { SchemaForm },
        data() {
            return {
                schema: {
                    name: {
                        component: FormText // Note that is NOT a string
                    },
                    lastName: {
                        component: FormText // We pass the component that we imported directly
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
</script>
```

## Component Requirements
Now that you have your schema bound into the `schema` prop, you need to make sure that your components are understood by `SchemaForm`.

Your component will receive a `value` property from the `SchemaFrom` that should be used to bind to the input's value. The component should also comply to `v-model` structure by `emit`ting an `input` event with the updated value for the component.

For custom components that wrap two or more input elements, `SchemaForm` will inject an object into the `value` property, with a property per each one of the inputs.

Ex:
```js
input: {
  firstName: '',
  lastName: ''
}
```

These components need to `emit` an `update-batch` event instead, where the payload is an object with this same structure.

An example component that wraps two text elements follows.

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <FormText label="Favorite color" :value="form.color" @input="textInput('color', $event)"></FormText>
    <FormText label="Favorite song" :value="form.song" @input="textInput('song', $event)"></FormText>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import FormText from './FormText'

export default {
  components: { FormText },
  data () {
    return {
      form: {
        color: '',
        song: ''
      }
    }
  },
  methods: {
    textInput (field, e) {
      this.$set(this.form, field, e)
      this.$emit('update-batch', this.form)
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

## Examples
Here you will find a few examples on how you can set up your `schema` and the output it would produce. 

Please note: We are using a few different custom components to showcase, but you should use your own! ðŸ˜‰

### Basic Usage
In this example you can see `SchemaForm` being used in its simplest form. A local SCHEMA is created, and passed into the `schema` property, which in return renders the function.

#### Schema

```js
const SCHEMA = {
  firstName: {
    component: FormText,
    label: 'First Name',
  },
  lastName: {
    component: FormText,
    label: 'Last Name',
  },
  email: {
    component: FormText,
    label: 'Your email',
    required: true,
    config: {
      type: 'email'
    }
  },
  isVueFan: {
    component: FormCheckbox,
    label: 'Are you a Vue fan?'
  }
}
```

#### Template
```js
<SchemaForm
    :schema="schema"
    v-model="userData"
/>
```

### Formception

### Schema Wizard

<SplitTab>
  <WizardExample slot="example" />
  <<< @/docs/.vuepress/components/WizardExample.vue
</SplitTab>

### MultiElement

The `SchemaForm` can handle custom components that wrap two or more child inputs.
They must emit the `update-batch` event with an object payload that has the values for each of the inputs.


<SplitTab>
  <MultiElementExample slot="example" />
  <<< @/docs/.vuepress/components/MultiElementExample.vue
</SplitTab>

### Shared Config

The `SchemaForm` includes a prop `sharedConfig` that applies a configuration object to all the elements in the form. 

In the following example, the prop `readOnly` is being globally applied to all the child components in the form, the `FormText` component disables and changes the color of the background when `readOnly` is set to true internally.

  <SharedConfigExample slot="example" />
